# About

This folder contains all the code nessecary to run the functions and create the histograms.
In the data folder you can find both a direct copy of the data set we used: LundData.csv,
and the cleaned up data set: CleanedLundData.csv along with the script used to clean it: Clean.sh.

To run the code simply log in to root via command line while in the code folder. 
rootlogon.C will then compile project.cpp which can then be executed by typing project() into the root command line.
The generated histograms can then be found in the histograms folder.
